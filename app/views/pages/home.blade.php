			<h1>Stop the Bullshit</h1>
			<p>There is a lot of bullshit in the Minecraft hosting business. McHostExposed is a non-affiliated, non-profit site created to better the community by calling out crappy hosts.</p>

			MCHR keeps the <span>crap out and the good in</span>. Founded by people from the &quot;inside,&quot; MCHR knows what goes on. We provide <span>non-partisan</span> ratings randomly or on request of hosts, giving a &quot;<span>bullshit rating</span>&quot; to each. Low is good, high is bad. That's all you need to know to <span>start finding the right host for you</span>.
